# COMP3005FinalProj
Repository containing all necessary files for a final school project.

To run the application: 
First run the SQL titled "initial setup" in postgres, this will generate all necessary tables and populate them with some initial test data. 

Then download Application.java and load in your prferred IDE (I used VSCode).
*Note* you will need the postgreSQL JAR file installed in your java project in order to integrate the 2 softwares. 

On line 1036 is the DB connection info, this will need to be changed as well to match your personal postgre DB info.
